# Restaurant_Data_Analysis

# Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on restaurant data using Python. The goal is to derive insights into various aspects of the restaurant industry, such as cuisine popularity, pricing, geographic distribution, ratings, and customer preferences.

# Dataset

The dataset includes information about restaurants, cuisines, locations, price ranges, ratings, votes, and online services. The data is cleaned and analyzed to extract meaningful trends.

# Libraries Used

numpy

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

folium (for geographic analysis)

# Data Preprocessing

Imported and explored the dataset.

Checked and handled missing values.

Converted relevant data types.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Top Cuisines

Identified the top three most common cuisines.

Calculated the percentage of restaurants serving each top cuisine.

## City Analysis

Determined the city with the highest number of restaurants.

Calculated the average restaurant rating for each city.

Identified the city with the highest average rating.

## Price Range Distribution

Created visualizations to show the distribution of price ranges.

Calculated the percentage of restaurants in each price category.

## Online Delivery

Determined the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.

Compared average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.

## Restaurant Ratings

Analyzed the distribution of ratings.

Identified the most common rating range.

Calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.

## Cuisine Combination

Identified the most frequent cuisine combinations.

Examined if certain cuisine combinations tend to receive higher ratings.

## Geographic Analysis

Plotted restaurant locations on a map using latitude and longitude.

Identified patterns and clusters of restaurants in specific areas.

## Restaurant Chains

Analyzed the presence of restaurant chains in the dataset.

Compared ratings and popularity of different restaurant chains.

## Restaurant Reviews

Calculated the average review length and explored its relationship with ratings.

## Votes Analysis

Identified restaurants with the highest and lowest votes.

Analyzed if there is a correlation between votes and restaurant ratings.

## Price Range vs. Online Delivery & Table Booking

Examined the relationship between price range and availability of online delivery and table booking.
